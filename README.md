## Welcome to HexSerf!

In HexSerf, the first player to 50,000 victory points wins!

Players gain victory points by controlling territory. Gain control of territory by placing pieces on the board. The more territory you control, the faster you gain victory points!

Pieces grow over the type of piece they are placed on. For example, if you place a green pitchfork on top of a blue sword, green pitchforks will continue to grow over adjacent blue swords until there are no more.

Your hand is displayed to the left. Over time, you will draw additional pieces until your hand is full. To play a piece, click on it in your hand or hit the appropriate key on your keyboard to select it, then click on the board to place the piece.

Each piece has an attack value, a defense value, and a growth speed. You can only place piece A on top of piece B if A's attack value is greater than B's defense value.
